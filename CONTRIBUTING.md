# Contributing to `novatip-web`

Thanks for your interest. The full contribution guide for every Novatip
repository lives in one place:

**[Novatip contributing guide](https://novatip-docs.pages.dev/contributing)**
([source](https://github.com/Novatip/novatip-docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md))

Read that first. This page only covers what is specific to this repository.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/novatip-web
cd novatip-web
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Novatip/novatip-web
git checkout -b fix/short-description
```

This app resolves `@novatip/sdk` from a sibling checkout, so clone and build
it alongside this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Novatip/novatip-sdk ../novatip-sdk
(cd ../novatip-sdk && npm ci && npm run build)
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # NEXT_PUBLIC_TIP_SPLITTER_CONTRACT_ID is required
```

## Before you push

CI runs exactly these, so run them locally first:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```
